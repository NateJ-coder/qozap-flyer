        <section id="features" class="reveal-on-scroll">
            <h2>Key Features (Under Development)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quote Generation & Sharing:</strong> After onboarding, service providers can generate quotes within the app and share them with clients in person or via WhatsApp/email.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Site Service & Invoice Preparation:</strong> Upon service completion, providers can tally expenses (e.g., materials), input their employee details, and tap "get invoice."</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Invoice Generation:</strong> The app will calculate total costs (expenses + labour + service fees based on onboarding setup) and generate a professional invoice with all the service provider's information, including the servicing employee's details and address. (Other compulsory professional invoice details will also be included).</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Payment Options with QR Code & Sharing:</strong> A QR code will be generated on the provider's phone for immediate scanning by the client. Alternatively, the invoice can be shared with the client via email, WhatsApp, or other platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Client-Side Payment Gateway:</strong> Clients will have a "pay now" button, redirecting them to a secure payment gateway to choose their preferred method: PayPal, other EFT gateways, card payment, or direct EFT (using the service provider's bank details provided during onboarding).</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Payment Reminders:</strong> Clients with outstanding bills will receive automated payment reminders (via email, WhatsApp, or the app, if downloaded) every 24 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Payment Tracking & Notifications:</strong> Service providers will receive instant notifications upon client payment, and the app will automatically log the payment, aiding in tracking outstanding invoices and payment history.</li>
                <li><strong>(Future Development) Enhanced Repeat Service:</strong> For returning clients, the app will store past service history. Upon payment for new services (via QR code or other methods), client payment details can be saved to streamline future transactions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <div class="faq-item reveal-on-scroll">
                <h3>What types of service providers will QoZap be for?</h3>
                <p>Initially, we're focusing on supporting a wide range of on-location service professionals in Port Alfred, including home cleaning and maintenance services, mobile beauty and wellness providers, tutors and personal trainers, pet groomers and walkers, as well as handymen and various repair services.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item reveal-on-scroll">
                <h3>Will QoZap be free to use?</h3>
                <p>We're currently exploring the best pricing model to ensure QoZap offers significant value without breaking the bank for our local service providers. We're committed to providing a cost-effective solution, and we'll be sharing more details about our pricing structure as we get closer to the official launch.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item reveal-on-scroll">
                <h3>How will clients pay through the QR code?</h3>
                <p>When we implement the QR code payment feature in QoZap, your client will simply use their smartphone's camera or a QR code scanning app to scan it. This will instantly direct them to a secure online payment page where they can conveniently complete the transaction using their preferred payment method. We're planning to integrate with popular and trusted payment gateways.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item reveal-on-scroll">
                <h3>What will happen after a client pays?</h3>
                <p>Once a client successfully makes a payment through the QR code system (once implemented), you'll receive an immediate notification within the QoZap app. The invoice status will also be automatically updated to "Paid" in your records.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item reveal-on-scroll">
                <h3>Will I be able to use QoZap on my phone and computer?</h3>
